# ruby_php #

An *early one-evening prototype* of a project to embed PHP inside Ruby so that legacy PHP code can be called from shiny new Ruby code. The goal is to not only be able to call PHP functions and methods but also wrap objects, arrays and blocks so that they can be passed between languages with relatively few surprises. Possible use cases include craziness like using RSpec to test a Zend Framework project or using ActiveRecords from a PHP script.

I'll probably really start this project during 2012.
